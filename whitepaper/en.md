# Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin: A Galactic Meme Coin Adventure!

Welcome, fellow travelers, to the **Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin (CCFC)** whitepaper! Buckle up for a journey that blends the refreshing taste of a cold Cristal with the hilarious power of memes, all fueled by the revolutionary **Internet Computer (ICP)**!

**May the Force be with you (and your thirst for a good meme coin)!**

## A Star Wars Fan's Dream (and a Meme Coin Reality)

We at CCFC HQ are not just beer lovers, we're **die-hard Star Wars fans**. So, when we saw the epic Cerveza Cristal ad grace the recent Star Wars movie, we knew it was a match made in meme heaven.

Here's the ad that started it all!:

CCFC is a **community-first meme coin**, built on the cutting-edge ICP. That means the power lies with YOU, the fans! We're talking Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), also known as a **Service Nervous System (SNS)** on ICP. Hold onto your spacesuits – this is gonna be wild!

## The Internet Computer: Your Decentralized Playground

The **Internet Computer** is like a **galactic cloud server** built for the public.  Imagine a network where you can create any system or service,  using fancy "canister software" (think smart contracts on steroids).  This opens the door for a whole new universe of **Web3 apps, social networks, and even streaming services**, all built on a secure and decentralized network. Pretty cool, right?

## Let's Talk Tokens, Baby! (Tokenomics Explained)

**We're all about community ownership**, so **50% of the tokens are reserved for the DAO treasury**.  Here's how the rest breaks down:

| Allocation       | Percentage | Tokens         | Memo                   |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Development Team | **10%**    | 100,000,000    | Locked for 0～5 months |
| SNS Swap         | **40%**    | 400,000,000    | Locked for 0～3 months |
| DAO Treasury     | **50%**    | 500,000,000    |                        |
|                  | -- **80%** | -- 400,000,000 | DEX & CEX Liquidity    |
|                  | -- **20%** | -- 100,000,000 | Marketing & Community  |

- **Development Team (10%)** – They get some tokens, but they're working hard for the cause (and fueled by CCFC itself, just like you!). These tokens are locked for a period to ensure commitment.
- **SNS Swap (40%)** – This is where you get your chance to snag some CCFC! We're aiming to raise some ICP through the swap, which all goes straight to the DAO treasury (more on that later).

**The DAO Treasury (50%)** is like our community war chest. Here's how we plan to use it:

- **DEX & CEX Liquidity (80%)**: A smooth-flowing market is key – we'll use these funds to make sure buying and selling CCFC is a breeze.
- **Marketing & Community (20%)**: Spreading the word about CCFC and building a vibrant community – that's what this is all about! The DAO will decide how these funds are used.
  
**Bonus Level Unlocked!** – If the Force is truly with us and we raise over 20,000 ICP, we'll use the extra funds to build tools that empower the entire **ICP Meme Coin ecosystem**. Talk about building a meme-tastic future together!

**There's even more!** Holding CCFC tokens lets you participate in DAO decisions and shape the future of the coin.
